# Function Reference

This document describes the functions in the core game scripts. Use your editor’s search or symbol list to jump to a function name here.

## app-core.js

### getSelectedCategories()
Reads the checked category checkboxes in the Practice settings modal and returns only values that exist in `dataSets`. This ensures the game never picks a category that has no backing data.

### getActiveCategories(currentRound)
Returns the category pool for the current round based on `gameMode`. In Endless mode it uses the endless rules; otherwise it uses the practice selections from the UI.

### getChallengeOptions(currentRound)
Builds the modifier settings for the round (math ops, misleading colors, background color recall, glitch). In Endless mode it reads the rule table; in Practice it reads the checkboxes.

### isPlatformerEnabled()
Returns whether the platformer modifier is active for the current round. In Endless it is driven by endless rules; in Practice by the checkbox.

### isAdEnabled()
Returns whether the ads modifier is active for the current round. In Endless it is driven by endless rules; in Practice by the checkbox.

### isFogEnabled()
Returns whether the fog modifier is active for the current round. In Endless it is driven by endless rules; in Practice by the checkbox.

### isSwapEnabled()
Returns whether the swap modifier is active for the current round. In Endless it is driven by endless rules; in Practice by the checkbox.

### skipRevealNow()
Ends the reveal phase early, cancels timers and ad scheduling, and transitions immediately into recall.

### updateModeUI()
Synchronizes `gameMode` with the hidden `modeSelect` control, updates the page’s data attributes, refreshes score/streak UI, and updates the endless leaderboard.

### updateCategoryControls()
Enables or disables category/modifier checkboxes depending on the active mode. Endless mode locks these inputs because rules are auto‑controlled.

### setPhase(text, nextState)
Updates the phase pill text and the `phase` state. Also toggles tutorial recall text visibility and updates streak visibility.

### updateScore()
Renders the pills for mode/round/score/lives and the streak indicator based on current game mode.

### updateStreakVisibility()
Shows the streak pill only during Practice/Endless active phases. Hides it for idle or tutorial states.

### clamp(value, min, max)
Utility to clamp a numeric value into a min/max range.

### resetBoard()
Clears the card grid, input grid, and results panel to prepare for a new round.

### normalize(value)
Normalizes user input for comparison by trimming and lower‑casing.

### isCorrectAnswer(item, actualValue)
Compares a user’s input to the expected answer with special handling for colors, directions, shapes, and background‑color prompts.

### buildChallenge(item, options)
Applies modifier logic to a base item: misleading labels, background‑color recall, and text/background color targets for color cards.

### pickItems()
Selects a unique set of items for the round from active categories, applies modifier transformations (including math ops), and returns the final list.

### resolveTutorialMessageCoord(value)
Normalizes tutorial message position values into CSS units (rem or %), or returns null for invalid input.

### applyTutorialMessagePosition(step)
Positions the tutorial message element based on a tutorial step’s `messagePosition` config.

### applyTutorialRecallMessagePosition(step)

## modifiers/misleading-colors.js

### pickMisleadingLabel(actualLabel)
Chooses a color name that differs from the true color to create misleading text for the color‑mislead modifier.

## modifiers/math-ops.js

### applyNumberChallenge(item)
Turns a number card into a math‑operation challenge (add/subtract/multiply), producing a new recall hint and answer.

### applyNumberChallenges(items, options)
Applies `applyNumberChallenge` to up to two number cards per round based on the configured probability.

## modifiers/glitch.js

### setGlitchActive(active)
